# -HEMT-Design-and-Simulation

ðŸ“– Overview
This repository contains the design files, TCAD simulation scripts, and performance analysis for a High Electron Mobility Transistor (HEMT) based on the AlGaN/GaN heterostructure.
The project focuses on modeling and characterizing both DC and RF performance of HEMTs for high-power and high-frequency applications.
A key feature of these devices is the formation of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the AlGaN/GaN interface. This occurs due to spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization, enabling high carrier concentration and mobility, making HEMTs ideal for next-generation power amplifiers and RF switches.
